# Codecademy-Portfolio-Project-US-Medical-Insurance

Hi there. 

If you're viewing this, you're probably shopping around my portfolio. Maybe you're my future boss. Maybe you're a recruiter. Maybe you're a future client. Or maybe you're just a curious person. 

Whatever the case, it's lovely to meet you. 

## What is this?

Being a Data Journalist is part writer, part data visualiser, and part data-jack-of-all-trades. As part of my eagerness to tell better stories, and to carry out better data analysis (and keep my career options open), I've been going through the [Codecademy Data Scientist (Machine Learning) Skill Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science) 

(I've completed the SQL part. You can view my certificate [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Legrq2X0gKU4fsR8XU_1eY_9k3Ftid8g/view?usp=drive_link)). 

This portfolio project was at the end of the Data Science Foundations section of the course. This section included:
 - Principles of Data Literacy
 - Learn SQL
 - Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part I)
 - Python Fundamentals for Data Science (Part II)
 - **Portfolio Project: US Medical Insurance** <--- *We are here*

(It's a big course).

It's intended to test one's independent analysis on real world data, to work locally and import a dataset into one's dev environment. Actually specifically:

 - Work locally on your own computer
 - Import a dataset into your program
 - Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
 - Use libraries to assist in your analysis
 - Optional: Document and organize your findings
 - Optional: Make predictions about a datasetâ€™s features based on your findings

## What did you learn?

* Good practice for scoping a data science project before execution
* Practise building functions to analyse nested dictionaries
* The difficulty in writing functions to perform simple analysis in with just lists and dictionaries (I suspect Pandas will make things easier...)

## Where can I view the code?

**[You can see my jupyter notebook solution here.](https://nbviewer.org/github/david-heasman00/Codecademy-Portfolio-Project-US-Medical-Insurance/blob/main/us-medical-insurance-costs.ipynb)**

## How can I speak to you?

Want to chat about a project, or a potential opportunity? I'm happy to connect [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidheasman/). Include a brief note in your connection request about why you're reaching out. 

Till later.
